          Findings and Recommendations
          ----------------------------

Finding 1: PL/SQL Execution
Impact is 0 active sessions, 21.15% of total activity.
------------------------------------------------------
PL/SQL execution consumed significant database time.

Instances that were significantly affected by this finding:
    Number  Name   Percent Impact  ADDM Task Name
    ------  -----  --------------  --------------
    1       svcg1  93.75           DBHC_18_05_2017$1
    2       svcg2  6.25            DBHC_18_05_2017$2

   Recommendation 1: SQL Tuning
   Estimated benefit is 0 active sessions, 21.15% of total activity.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Tune the entry point PL/SQL
      "SYS.DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.AWR_REPORT_HTML" of type "PACKAGE" and ID
      8865. Refer to the PL/SQL documentation for addition information.
   Rationale
      152 seconds spent in executing PL/SQL
      "SYS.DBMS_SWRF_REPORT_INTERNAL.AWR_REPORT_MAIN" of type "PACKAGE" and ID
      8877.


Finding 2: "User I/O" wait Class
Impact is 0 active sessions, 20.39% of total activity.
------------------------------------------------------
Wait class "User I/O" was consuming significant database time.
The throughput of the I/O subsystem was not significantly lower than expected.

Instances that were significantly affected by this finding:
    Number  Name   Percent Impact  ADDM Task Name
    ------  -----  --------------  --------------
    1       svcg1  98.32           DBHC_18_05_2017$1

   No recommendations are available.


Finding 3: Top SQL Statements
Impact is 0 active sessions, 13.46% of total activity.
------------------------------------------------------
SQL statements consuming significant database time were found. These
statements offer a good opportunity for performance improvement.

   Recommendation 1: SQL Tuning
   Estimated benefit is 0 active sessions, 13.46% of total activity.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Run SQL Tuning Advisor on the SELECT statement with SQL_ID
      "37bfgts650417".
      Related Object
         SQL statement with SQL_ID 37bfgts650417.
         select output from table(dbms_workload_repository.awr_report_html(410
         6146248,         1,        749,        772, 0))
   Rationale
      The SQL spent 100% of its database time on CPU, I/O and Cluster waits.
      This part of database time may be improved by the SQL Tuning Advisor.
   Rationale
      Database time for this SQL was divided as follows: 0% for SQL execution,
      0% for parsing, 100% for PL/SQL execution and 0% for Java execution.
   Rationale
      SQL statement with SQL_ID "37bfgts650417" was executed 16 times and had
      an average elapsed time of 5.4 seconds.


Finding 4: Hard Parse
Impact is 0 active sessions, 6.63% of total activity.
-----------------------------------------------------
Hard parsing of SQL statements was consuming significant database time in some
instances.

Instances that were significantly affected by this finding:
    Number  Name   Percent Impact  ADDM Task Name
    ------  -----  --------------  --------------
    1       svcg1  100             DBHC_18_05_2017$1

   Recommendation 1: Examine instance ADDM
   Estimated benefit is 0 active sessions, 6.63% of total activity.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      No recommendations are available at the database level. Check the ADDM
      analysis of affected instances for recommendations.


Finding 5: Unusual "Other" Wait Event
Impact is 0 active sessions, 5.35% of total activity.
-----------------------------------------------------
Wait event "name-service call wait" in wait class "Other" was consuming
significant database time.

   Recommendation 1: Application Analysis
   Estimated benefit is 0 active sessions, 5.35% of total activity.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate the cause for high "name-service call wait" waits. Refer to
      Oracle's "Database Reference" for the description of this wait event.

   Symptoms That Led to the Finding:
   ---------------------------------
      Wait class "Other" was consuming significant database time.
      Impact is 0 active sessions, 8.52% of total activity.
