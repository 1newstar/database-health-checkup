# Oracle Database Health Check Script Unix Platforms.

The script is designed to collect logs and metrics from O/S, Database Instance and Clusterware if exits. The script is interactive so it prompts input from the user. It also generates AWR/ADDM reports for 24 hrs, from stript fired time minus 24.
